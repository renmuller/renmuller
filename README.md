### Hi there 👋

My name is Karen and I am an inquisitive, optimistic Github newbie. As a fan of all things tech, I enjoy learning new languages (human and computer) and am currently deep-diving into AWS and Python. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner qualification
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS, Python, Linux Bash Shell at TechTalent Academy
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on improving my internet visibility via social media, vlog posts etc.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with starting a career in AWS.
- 💬 Ask me about: anything!
- 📫 How to reach me: www.linkedin.com/in/karen-m-muller

- ⚡ Fun fact 2: I actually have 3 OCP-Java qualifications (from a while back)...but never used it 👀 (Need a complete update - a refresher course is on my ToDo list though!)😃👌
